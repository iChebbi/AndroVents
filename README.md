# AndroVents
An android app to discover events and get informations about their time and place.

This is an Android Studio project, built using version `2.3.1` and minimum SDK 23.
This app parses events data from a public `JSON API`. Check [Eventful.com](http://api.eventful.com/) for more events API.
Events that you choose to participate in, are stored in `sqlite` database.

This is a proof of concept source code, developed as part of an Android Bootcamp. You can customize it to suit your needs by changing the `JSON API` in the `EventList` java file and make sure to make the needed changes for the `JSON Parser`.
